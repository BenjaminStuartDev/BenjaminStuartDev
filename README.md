# Welcome! 👋

Hello there, I'm Ben - a code monkey in training! 🐒 As a junior software developer, I love creating magical software solutions that solve real-world problems. I'm always on the lookout for new architectural patterns and tools to help me level up my skills and build more powerful and efficient software.

When I'm not slinging code, you can usually find me exploring the latest tech trends, tinkering with new development tools, or trying to catch up on my never-ending reading list. 📚

If you want to chat about coding, share some cool development tricks or collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always up for a good coding adventure! 💻
